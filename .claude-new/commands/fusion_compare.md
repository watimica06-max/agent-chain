allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, Bash, Agent
argument-hint: "<feature folder name>"
---

Act as the orchestrator, in **upstream mode**.

**This command invokes `fusionneur`, invocation 1 — Compare and question.**

**The argument is mandatory**: the feature folder name. Without it, ask
for it and stop — never guess which feature is meant.

Feature folder: `docs/features/$ARGUMENTS/`

---

## Before anything else

🔴 **`desc-produit-fusion.md` absent → stop.** 📌 **Say to run `/fusion`
first** — ⚠️ **only its Rédacteur row writes that file**, and the
Fusionneur reads it and nothing else.

---

## What you read

Nothing. Each agent declares its own inputs; you pass the feature
folder and nothing else. `CLAUDE.md`'s standing reading rules apply:
never open `CURRENT_TECHNICAL_STATE.md`.

---

## Git, before invoking

🔴 **Before invoking, move every root `questions-*.md` whose prefix is
not `fusionneur`:**

    git mv docs/features/<name>/questions-<other>-NN.md \
           docs/features/<name>/questions/<other>/

⚠️ **`git mv`, never a read-and-rewrite** — the agent must not open
those files, and neither should you.

🔴 **And every `questions-fusionneur-NN.md` but the highest** — the
last one stays at the root, it carries the numbering.

📌 **Create `questions/<agent>/` if it does not exist.**

🔴 **Then commit the feature folder**, before creating the worktree:

    git add docs/features/<name>/ && git commit -m "chore: answers"

⚠️ **The Product Owner fills `Answer:` fields by hand, outside this
session.** A worktree branches from the last commit — uncommitted
answers are invisible inside it, and the agent works on a stale
`questions.md`. *(Seen once: 186 lines in the worktree, 195 in the main
checkout.)*

📌 **Nothing to commit is a normal outcome** — carry on.

🔴 **Then create a worktree from local `HEAD`, and register it:**

    git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> HEAD

⚠️ **Never let the tooling branch it for you** — its default base is
`origin/master`, which can sit several commits behind local. An agent
would then work on stale content and its output would have to be
discarded. *(Seen once: a whole invocation lost that way.)*

📌 **Enter the worktree before invoking the agent**, not after it
fails — the harness blocks a subagent's writes until the session is
isolated. *(Measured on three
phases: the agent does the full job, cannot write, and the whole
invocation is redone.)*

---

## How it runs

**What you do**: invoke the agent via `Agent()` with the feature folder
and which invocation it is — and nothing else.

🔴 **Never paraphrase the agent's process in your invocation** — not
its inputs, its checks, its output format. It reads its own
instructions.

### Invocation parameters

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="<agent>",
  model="sonnet",
  description="<phase> <feature>",
  prompt="Feature folder: docs/features/<name>/. <Which invocation>."
)
```

❌ No `effort` parameter. ⚠️ **`run_in_background` may not exist
either** — in this environment the Agent tool always runs async and
notifies on completion. Do not pass it; wait for the notification.

❌ **Never pass `isolation`** — the phases are sequential
and each reads what the previous one wrote.

---

## Git, once it has reported

**Then, once the agent reports:**

1. `git merge --no-ff <branch>` from the main checkout root
2. `git push`
3. `git worktree remove <path>`

🔴 **The push is part of the merge, not an afterthought.** A phase that
sits only on the local machine is lost with it.

⚠️ **A push that fails — diverged remote, no network — is reported, not
retried and not worked around.** The merge holds locally; say so and
carry on.

🔴 **Merge before handing back, always** — a phase whose output sits on
an unmerged branch is invisible to the next one. ⚠️ **A
`blocked_*.md` merges too**: the Product Owner has to see it.

---

## What you relay

The agent's own report, and nothing more. 🔴 **Nothing else is yours**:
no phase chain.

**If it returns a `blocked_*.md`**: relay it and stop.
